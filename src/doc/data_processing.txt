The data coming from SySal scanning:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Axis Z direction is from bottom to top on the stage.
-  fiducial marks are on the bottom surface

in the data coming after convertor (in Edb):

- top views segments and clusters has higher Z
- segments.eSide is "0" for top, "1" for bottom
- eNframesTop=0 for bottom side views
  eNframesBot=0 for top    side views

  to select top/bottom views used eNframesTop/Bot values (from the view header)


During the linking (in "couples" tree):

       - up    side data is read first as pattern 1, and segments go to s1.
       - down  side data is read next  as pattern 2, and segments go to s2.


       Shrinkage correction:

       shrinkage = (exposure thickness) / (measured on stage thickness),  so:

       angle_exposured = angle_found/shrinkage


Data processing:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     - check the quality of raw data using the script check_raw.C

     - link data using the script link.C
	    The parameters using for linking:
	    
  float  plate[3] = {40, 214, 40};  - plate parameters (up, base, down)
	                              base - is the most important parameter - it is used
				      for calculation of base angle. 
				      up and down are used to project the base point to the 
				      centre of emulsion layer - it helps to improve the 
				      accuracy of segment position. 
				      With setting {0,214,0} base point is used for 
				      calculations as is

  float  shrU  = 0.93;              //  (exposure thickness) / (measured on stage thickness):
  float  shrD  = 0.73;              //  tx_exp = tx_stage/shr
				    
	 shrinkage parameters are used for correction of the raw 
	 data angles after reading
	 Note that shrinkage and base are correlated: first it is necessary 
	 to fix the base and then correct shrinkage if necessary

  float  uOff[2] = {0.,0.};      // s1.eTX-s.eTX, s1.eTY-s.eTY  (at 0 angle)
  float  dOff[2] = {0.,0.};      // s2.eTX-s.eTX, -(s2.eTY-s.eTY)

	 angular offsets could be presented in the distorted emulsions

	 All the above parameters are used to correct angular distributions 
	 for minimization of chi2 for signal tracks.
