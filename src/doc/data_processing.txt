The data coming from SySal scanning:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Axis Z direction is from bottom to top on the stage.
-  fiducial marks are on the bottom surface

in the data coming after convertor (in Edb):

- top views segments and clusters has higher Z
- segments.eSide is "0" for top, "1" for bottom
- eNframesTop=0 for bottom side views
  eNframesBot=0 for top    side views

  to select top/bottom views used eNframesTop/Bot values (from the view header)


During the linking (in "couples" tree):

       - up    side data is read first as pattern 1, and segments go to s1.
       - down  side data is read next  as pattern 2, and segments go to s2.


       Shrinkage correction:

       shrinkage = (exposure thickness) / (measured on stage thickness),  so:

       angle_exposured = angle_found/shrinkage
