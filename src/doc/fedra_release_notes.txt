In new version of convertor (based on the new SysalDataIO) the eAreaID is 
started from 1 instead of 0. 

Schema evolution problems: eElements branch was commented out by 
the //! in EdbSegment.h. Seems not back-compatible - the data should 
be reconverted. The old data is readable anyway with no loading 
libraries, but if new version of libraries are loaded them give segfault 
(Views->Draw("eAreaID*121")
