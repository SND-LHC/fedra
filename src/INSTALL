Now this procedure is obsolete: use install.sh instead

development installation procedure (will be modified):

in setup.sh set the correct value for FEDRA_ROOT
This important only for running

in config/ProjectDef.mk set the correct PROJECT_ROOT
this need for building

in config/setlinks.sh set the correct paths for include and src
this important if includes are going to be changed

./setlinks.sh
cd ..
./setup.sh
./makeall.sh

at this step all libraries should be builded and available 
from $FEDRA_ROOT/lib
