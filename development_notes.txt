  several bugs fixed


9-Jun-2005: VT

- fedra.rootrc file added, $FEDRA_ROOT/macros directory is creating by install.sh

- check_tr.C modified - efficiency plot added


10-Jun-2005: VT

- Modifications of traching for carbonium problem: 
  - function SetCouplesPeriodic()
  - EdbPatCouple::FillCell_XYaXaY: exclude segments already used for tracks (to check side effects!!)
	- release used segments for discarded tracks 
	- track number should increase for second pass!

13-Jun-2005: VT&YP

  - vertex search: LoopVertex&ProbVertex modified to follow the logic 
     "eDZmax - the maximal z-distance in track-vertex-track group"

13-Jun-2005: VT
  - remove the obsolete logic with "holes" from MakeTrack, EdbDataProc
    TODO: remove it from recset, 

  - the repetetive propagation working - to test it!
    TODO: otsechka trekov po veroiatnosti - revisia PropagateTracks

14-Jun-2005: YP
   - modifications in EdbDisplay for segment neighborhood functionality

14-Jun-2005: VT
  - track.Flag() is now used for repeated track search TODO: check the usage of this parameter in all code!

  - working Carbonium test procedure used SetCouplesPeriodic - to test more, to generalize the 
    pilot functions in EdbDataSet

//______________________________________________________________________________
void EdbPVRec::FitTracks(float p, float mass, TObjArray *gener, int design)
{
  // measurement errors: TODO
  // TODO: move gener logic out from EdbPVRec

20-Jul-2005 VT:

- added the libEoi - the ORACLE interface library written by Nikolay tested by Luillo

21-Jul-2005 VT:

- to build root with oracle support: 
/configure  --enable-oracle  --with-oracle-incdir=/sw/oracle/instantclient_10_2/sdk/include  --with-oracle-libdir=/sw/oracle/instantclient_10_2

problem: 
root [0]  TSQLServer *db=TSQLServer::Connect("oracle://dboperan:1521/dboperan","OPERA","ScanLab");
Error in <TOracleServer::TOracleServer>: connection to Oracle database dboperan failed (error: ORA-12514: TNS:listener does not currently know of service requested in connect descriptor
resolved: by setting dboperan in /etc/hosts (and relogin)
This was not workingo fofr Igor anyway
The final solution is to set correctly tnsnames.ora and give as server THIS mashine, since on 
this mashine are available services described in tnsnames.ora

12-Sep-2005 VT:
Problem with unstable alignment for small volumes: it appeared to be that alignment is unstable if nbins (x,y) is 
too big (to fix yet) the workaround: put nbin=4 and increase sx/sy if necessary. 
The second problem was z-gap tuning not working correctly for small samples - fixed by the FineCorrZnew - working well now.
